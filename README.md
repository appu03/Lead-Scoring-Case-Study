# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
BUILDING A PREDICTIVE MODEL TO CLASSIFY CUSTOMERS INTO POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS i.e LEADS THROUGH LOGISTIC REGRESSION
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead
The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor
To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up.
X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
